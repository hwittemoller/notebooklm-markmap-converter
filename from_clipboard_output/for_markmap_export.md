- # Schema Priming: Boost Learning Efficiency
    - ## What is Schema Priming?
        - ### Brain's Information Processing
            - #### Understand new information
            - #### Fit new information with existing knowledge
            - #### Prunes and filters information
            - #### Relates to existing knowledge
        - ### Schema Definition
            - #### Big picture
            - #### How things fit together
            - #### Web of ideas and concepts
            - #### Memory structure
        - ### Importance of Early Schema Formation
            - #### Prevents memory leaking/fading
            - #### Difficult/overwhelming if formed later
            - #### Memory poor until organized
            - #### Not automatic (requires active creation)
        - ### Benefit of Upfront Schema
            - #### Brain focuses on 'what it is'
            - #### Already knows 'where it fits'
            - #### Easier information organization
        - ### Quick process (10 minutes)
    - ## Three Steps to Schema Priming
        - ### Step 1: Scope the Topic
            - #### Get a lay of the land
            - #### Identify main ideas/pillars
            - #### Create basic scaffolds of networks
            - #### Techniques for Scoping
                - ##### Syntopical Reading
                    - ###### Read multiple resources simultaneously
                    - ###### Combine ideas from different sources
                    - ###### Avoid missing important perspectives
                - ##### Smart Skimming
                    - ###### Actively look for important items
                    - ###### Headings and subheadings
                    - ###### Diagrams, bolded words
                    - ###### Be selective, ignore the rest (for now)
                - ##### Detail Coding
                    - ###### Understand depth of detail in sources
                    - ###### Know where to find specific answers
        - ### Step 2: Make Judgments and Hypotheses
            - #### Actively build schema
            - #### Compare and contrast ideas
            - #### Judge influence/importance of concepts
            - #### Think about ideas in bigger picture
            - #### Hypotheses: don't need certainty
            - #### Give brain a head start
            - #### Focus on 'how to think', not 'what to remember'
        - ### Step 3: Prep Your Future Self
            - #### Supercharged highlighting
            - #### Identify unknowns and complicated areas
            - #### Set Flags (Questions)
                - ##### Note complicated areas
                - ##### Reminds future self of complexity
                - ##### Maintains schema perspective
            - #### Actively Find Problems
                - ##### Look for things that don't make sense
                - ##### Mental targets for future learning
                - ##### Helps brain be more critical/focused
            - #### Helps brain process more effectively
    - ## Indicators of Correct Schema Priming
        - ### Time
            - #### Fast process: 5-10 minutes maximum
            - #### Longer indicates too much detail
            - #### Focus on 'how to think', not 'what to remember'
        - ### Comfort with Topic
            - #### May feel uncomfortable at first
            - #### Should feel comfortable learning about it
            - #### Know how to think about it
        - ### Type of Knowledge
            - #### Good big picture understanding
            - #### NOT memorized definitions
            - #### NOT able to explain concepts in detail
            - #### Focus on wide/superficial connections, not isolated depth
    - ## Benefits of Schema Priming
        - ### Significantly boosts retention
        - ### Increases comfort with topic
        - ### Makes learning more engaging
    - ## Part of a complete learning system
